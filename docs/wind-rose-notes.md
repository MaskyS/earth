Let me break this down:

Input Data Analysis

GFS provides U and V wind components in m/s
Data is on a global grid (360°x181° resolution)
Each point has both U (east-west) and V (north-south) components
Time dimension appears to be present (refTime and forecastTime)
Data comes with comprehensive metadata in header


Desired Output Analysis (looking at your wind rose formats)

Direction bins (varying resolutions: 90°, 45°, 22.5°, 10°)
Speed bins (consistent across formats: 0-2, 2-4, 4-6 km/h etc.)
Frequencies or counts in each direction-speed combination
Units in km/h (need conversion from m/s)


Required Data Transformations

Spatial: Grid point selection/interpolation for location of interest
Vector to polar: Convert U/V components to speed and direction
Unit conversion: m/s to km/h
Temporal aggregation: If using multiple timestamps
Binning: Both speed and direction need binning
Frequency calculation: Count or percentage in each bin


Data Quality Considerations

Missing or null values in GFS data
Edge cases in vector calculations
Grid interpolation accuracy
Temporal consistency
Coordinate system alignment


Statistical Requirements

Minimum sample size for meaningful wind rose
Handling of calm conditions (very low wind speeds)
Statistical significance of bin counts
Outlier detection and handling

let me explain "binning" in the context of wind data at a specific point (34.47°N, 117.99°W).
Binning is like sorting data into predefined "buckets" or categories. For wind data, we bin in two dimensions:

Speed Binning
Looking at your data formats, you have speed bins like:


0 to 2 km/h
2 to 4 km/h
4 to 6 km/h
etc.

So if GFS gives us a wind speed of 5.3 km/h, it would go in the "4 to 6 km/h" bin.

Direction Binning
Your formats show different direction binning resolutions:


90° bins: Just N,E,S,W
45° bins: N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW
22.5° bins: N,NNE,NE,ENE,E,ESE,SE,SSE,S,SSW,SW,WSW,W,WNW,NW,NNW
10° bins: 0°,10°,20°,30°... etc.

So when you click 34.47°N, 117.99°W:

First, we get the raw GFS data for that point:
CopyU-component: -3.2 m/s
V-component: 2.1 m/s

Convert these components to:

Speed = √(U² + V²) = √((-3.2)² + 2.1²) = 3.83 m/s
Convert to km/h: 3.83 * 3.6 = 13.79 km/h
Direction = 270° - arctan(V/U) = 236.7°


Then bin both values:

13.79 km/h falls in the "12 to 14 km/h" bin
236.7° in different binning systems would be:

90° system: "W"
45° system: "SW"
22.5° system: "WSW"
10° system: "240°"





This is how one instantaneous measurement gets "binned". Usually, you'd do this for many measurements over time to build up the frequency distribution that makes up a wind rose.
Would you like me to show you how this binning process works with real GFS data for your location?
